# Registeration_and_login_project_vanilla_PHP

So I've finished my first project. It probably isn't very good, but i had great time building it. I learnt alot and i'm looking forward to learn more of PHP and backend development. 

If there are any ways to do something in this project better than i did (a lot i assume) feel free to DM me, allways great to get some feedback and knowledge.
